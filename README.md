## 💪 Deployment Notes

### ✅ Backend Deployment:

- Successfully deployed using [Render](https://week-7-devops-deployment-assignment-bpkj.onrender.com)
- All backend routes, middleware, and MongoDB connection are working live

### ⚠️ Frontend Vercel Issue:

- I initially attempted to deploy the frontend to **Vercel**, but was **unable to grant access to the GitHub Classroom organization (`PLP-MERN-Stack-Development`)**

- The error message received:

  > **"This action must be performed by an organization owner"**

- Since I am not the owner of the GitHub organization, I could not authorize Vercel access.

### ✅ Frontend Deployment (Netlify Workaround):

- As an alternative, I successfully deployed the frontend using **Netlify**
- The app is live and functional with full connection to the backend

---

## 🧪 How to Test

1. Visit the frontend Netlify URL
2. Try registering, logging in, or using features that hit the API
3. API calls are served via the backend hosted on Render
